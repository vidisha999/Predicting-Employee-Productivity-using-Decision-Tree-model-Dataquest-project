# Predicting-Employee-Productivity-using-Decision-Tree-model-Dataquest-project

## Project Focus 

The goal of this project is to use Tree models in  predicting the productivity of employees of a garment factory. Both Decision Tree and Random Forest models were used for this task. The prediction of the productivity can be meassured as a classification or regression task by using the above tree models. When using as a classification purpose, the predictivity which is the target variable should be transformed in to different classes in the range of (0-1), while when using as a regression purpose, the predictivity can be predicted in the range of 0-1.

## Background 

The Decision Tree and Random Forest Tree models are both supervised learning algorithms, which uses labellebd data to predict to make predictions. The Decison Tree is a single tree structure that splits data based on feature values to make predictions. A Random Forest Tree model is a ensambled collection of  multiple decision trees which were often trained on bootstraped subsets of data. Random Forest tree method considered more robust and accurate compared to a single decision tree as it reduces the overfitting by  averaging the predictions of the multiple trees.

## Data

The dataset for this projec is obtained from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/597/productivity+prediction+of+garment+employees). The[dataset]() contains several feature columns and the target variable `actual_productivity` which represents the actual percentage of the productivity that was delivered by the workers in the range of 0-1.
